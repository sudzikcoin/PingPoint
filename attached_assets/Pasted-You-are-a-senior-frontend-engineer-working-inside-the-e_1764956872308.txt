You are a senior frontend engineer working inside the existing PingPoint frontend project on Replit.

ASSUME:
- Stack: Next.js App Router (app/), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- There are already:
  - Driver views under `/driver/*`.
  - A control zone for broker/dispatcher under `/app/loads`.
- Arcade / WarCat Mode 90 animations (scanlines, flicker, etc.) already exist and can be reused.

YOUR TASK:
Create a new landing / home screen at the root route `/` with:
1) A short arcade-style intro animation (≈3 seconds).
2) After that, a simple role selector with two big buttons: “Broker” and “Dispatcher”.

Do NOT break existing routes `/driver/*` or `/app/loads`. Keep edits minimal and consistent with current code style.

============================================================
1. ROOT PAGE AT "/"
============================================================

Create or update `app/page.tsx` to be a client component (because it uses state and effects).

Behavior:
- When user opens `/`, show a full-screen intro animation for about 3 seconds.
- After 3 seconds, fade/transition to a role selection screen.
- The rest of the app (driver zone and control zone) must remain reachable directly via `/driver` and `/app/loads`.

Implementation idea:
- Use `useState` with boolean `showIntro` (initially true).
- In `useEffect`, call `setTimeout(() => setShowIntro(false), 3000)` and clear timeout on cleanup.
- Render:
  - If `showIntro` is true → render `IntroAnimationView`.
  - Otherwise → render `RoleSelectorView`.

Wrap everything in a full-screen container, for example a `div` with `min-h-screen`, dark background, centered content.

============================================================
2. INTRO ANIMATION VIEW (PAC-MAN STYLE TRUCK)
============================================================

Goal: A 3-second arcade animation that visually explains PingPoint.

Layout:
- Full-screen dark background (same palette as other pages).
- At the top center: neon sign style text:
  - Big title: `PINGPOINT`
  - Small subtitle underneath: `by SuVerse Labs`
- Below the title: a rounded rectangular “map” area that looks like an arcade game screen.

Inside the map area:
- A simple route made of dots (like a Pac-Man path).
  - For example, a horizontal or L-shaped path of small circular dots.
- A truck icon that moves along the path:
  - This can be a small square/rounded div or icon styled as a truck.
  - It should animate from start to end of the path in about 3 seconds.
- As the truck passes, dots it “eats” should disappear or fade out:
  - Use CSS animations with `animation-delay` so each dot fades out slightly after the previous one, synchronized with the truck movement.
- Ghosts:
  - A few small “ghost” elements (round or ghost-shaped) drift slowly around the route.
  - They should look a bit like GPT ghosts (e.g. tiny glowing eyes or simple “GPT” text).
  - Use a gentle floating animation (up/down or left/right).

Styling:
- Use existing arcade helpers where appropriate:
  - Wrap the map container in classes like `.arcade-scanline` and `.arcade-flicker` so it feels like a CRT monitor.
- Add a text glow class for the title, for example:
  - A utility like `landing-neon` that applies bright text-shadow and subtle pulsing.
- Add new keyframes in the global CSS (e.g. `globals.css` or `index.css`) to support:
  - `truck-move` (moves the truck along X/Y axis over 3 seconds).
  - `dot-eat` (fades dot opacity from 1 to 0 over the duration).
  - `ghost-drift` (slow oscillation to make ghosts float).
- Use these classes on the respective elements so the animation runs once and finishes in about 3 seconds.

Important:
- The intro is purely cosmetic. It does not need user input and should not block navigation once it finishes.
- Keep performance in mind: limit the number of DOM elements and avoid heavy box-shadow blur if unnecessary.

============================================================
3. ROLE SELECTOR VIEW (BROKER / DISPATCHER)
============================================================

After `showIntro` becomes false, show `RoleSelectorView`.

Layout:
- Full-screen or centered card over the same dark background.
- At top center:
  - Same neon title `PINGPOINT` and subtitle `by SuVerse Labs`, but smaller than in the intro.
- Below that, some small text like “Choose your console” (optional).
- In the center, two large neon buttons:
  - Button 1: “Broker”
  - Button 2: “Dispatcher”
- Buttons should feel like arcade-style pill buttons:
  - Reuse existing `PillButton` or `Button` component if available (e.g. from `client/src/components/ui/pill-button.tsx`).
  - Add glow and subtle hover/press animations by reusing WarCat Mode classes.

Behavior:
- Clicking “Broker”:
  - Navigate to `/app/loads?role=broker`.
- Clicking “Dispatcher”:
  - Navigate to `/app/loads?role=dispatcher`.

You can use Next.js `Link` components or `useRouter().push` for navigation.
Add a comment: `// TODO: later enforce real auth/role-based access; currently the role is only a UI hint via query string`.

Optional:
- If `/app/loads` already supports reading `role` from search params, you can adjust labels (e.g. show “Broker View” in header). Otherwise, just pass the param for now and leave a `// TODO` to wire it later.

============================================================
4. CSS AND ANIMATION NOTES
============================================================

In the main CSS file:
- Add a `.landing-neon` class for the PingPoint title:
  - Strong text-shadow in yellow/amber, slight pulsing with keyframes if desired.
- Add keyframes:
  - `@keyframes truck-move { 0% { transform: translateX(0%); } 100% { transform: translateX(100%); } }`
  - `@keyframes dot-eat { 0% { opacity: 1; } 80% { opacity: 1; } 100% { opacity: 0; } }`
  - `@keyframes ghost-drift { 0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); } 50% { transform: translateY(-6px); } }`
- Add simple classes like `.truck-icon`, `.truck-dot`, `.ghost` that apply these animations with appropriate duration and delay.

Apply them in your JSX so that:
- The truck moves across the route once in 3 seconds.
- Dots fade out sequentially behind the truck.
- Ghosts constantly float up and down.

============================================================
5. INTEGRATION AND SAFETY CHECKS
============================================================

- Ensure `/driver` still renders the existing driver dashboard unchanged.
- Ensure `/app/loads` still opens the Broker/Dispatcher control zone.
- Visiting `/` now shows:
  - 3-second intro animation with map, truck eating dots, and GPT ghosts.
  - Then automatically switches to the role selector with two neon buttons.
- Test on mobile and desktop in Replit preview to verify:
  - Animation runs smoothly.
  - Buttons navigate correctly to `/app/loads?role=broker` and `/app/loads?role=dispatcher`.
- Keep all new code consistent with project patterns. Add `// TODO` comments where later backend integration or auth will be required.

Implement this landing page now in the PingPoint project.
