You are the Replit Backend Agent working on the existing `agentos-tracking-core` project.

GOAL: On the **driver-facing UI** (PingPoint Driver), hide the internal load ID like `LD-2025-4474` and instead show ONLY the broker’s load number that is entered in the “Customer Ref / Load Number / Optional PO #” field when the load is created.

This change must:
- affect ONLY the DRIVER views (PingPoint driver dashboard and driver load details),
- reuse an existing field (e.g. `customerRef`, `customerRefNumber`, or similar) that already stores the broker’s reference,
- keep the internal ID for internal/admin views (`/app/loads`, dispatcher UI) untouched.

Do NOT change any backend business logic, Prisma IDs, or routes. Only adjust how the load number is displayed on driver-facing components.

────────────────────────
1. IDENTIFY THE BROKER LOAD NUMBER FIELD
────────────────────────

1) Locate the load creation / edit form used at `/app/loads/new` and `/app/loads/[id]` (likely in `src/app/app/loads/new/page.tsx` or similar).
   - Find the input labeled something like:
     - “Customer Ref”
     - “Customer Reference”
     - “Optional PO #”
     - or similar.
   - Confirm which **field name** on the load model it is bound to (for example `customerRef` on `TrackingLoad` / `OsLoad`).

2) Once identified, treat this field as **the broker-facing load number** we want to show to drivers.
   - For the rest of this task, I’ll refer to this field as `load.customerRef`. If the real name is different, replace `customerRef` with the correct property everywhere below.

DO NOT modify the schema or the form bindings; just reuse this existing field.

────────────────────────
2. DRIVER LOAD DETAIL PAGE – USE BROKER NUMBER
────────────────────────

Target file: driver load detail view, e.g.
- `src/app/driver/loads/[id]/page.tsx`
or the client shell component it uses (for Arcade90s/Premium themes).

1) Find the header where the internal load ID is currently rendered. It likely shows something like:

- `LOAD #LD-2025-4474`
- or uses a property named `load.displayId`, `load.humanReadableId`, `load.publicId`, or simply `load.id`.

Example (approximate):

  <span className="...">
    LOAD #{load.displayId}
  </span>

2) Introduce a **driverDisplayId** variable that prioritizes `customerRef`:

In the component where `load` is available, define:

  const driverDisplayId =
    load.customerRef && load.customerRef.trim().length > 0
      ? load.customerRef.trim()
      : (load.displayId ?? load.humanReadableId ?? load.id);

3) Use `driverDisplayId` in the driver header:

- Replace any direct usage of the internal ID with `driverDisplayId`.

Example:

  <span className="text-xs uppercase tracking-[0.25em] text-arc-muted">
    LOAD #{driverDisplayId}
  </span>

or, if you don’t want the “LOAD #” prefix visible to the driver, you can simplify to just the number:

  <span className="...">
    {driverDisplayId}
  </span>

But per requirement we MUST NOT show `LD-2025-xxxx` when a broker ref exists, so make sure you use the conditional above.

────────────────────────
3. DRIVER DASHBOARD (/driver) – USE SAME DISPLAY LOGIC
────────────────────────

Target file: driver dashboard list page, e.g.
- `src/app/driver/page.tsx`
or a `DriverLoadsList` component that renders the driver’s loads.

1) Find the section where each load row shows the load number (currently showing `LD-2025-4474`).

Example:

  <Link ...>
    <span className="...">
      {load.displayId}
    </span>
  </Link>

2) For each load in the list, compute a `driverDisplayId` exactly as in step 2:

  const driverDisplayId =
    load.customerRef && load.customerRef.trim().length > 0
      ? load.customerRef.trim()
      : (load.displayId ?? load.humanReadableId ?? load.id);

3) Use `driverDisplayId` in the UI instead of the internal ID.

This ensures the driver sees the **same broker load number** consistently both in the list and in the detail view.

────────────────────────
4. DO NOT CHANGE INTERNAL / DISPATCHER VIEWS
────────────────────────

On dispatcher / admin routes (e.g. `/app/loads`, `/app/loads/[id]`):

- Keep showing the internal ID (`LD-2025-XXXX`) for clarity, together with the broker reference if you already show it.
- Do NOT replace internal IDs there; the requirement only applies on **driver-side** (PingPoint Driver).

So:
- `/app/loads` – can continue to show both:
  - internal ID: `LD-2025-4474`
  - broker ref: `customerRef` if needed.
- `/driver` and `/driver/loads/[id]` – show ONLY `driverDisplayId` computed as described.

────────────────────────
5. NULL / EMPTY SAFETY
────────────────────────

Make sure that if `customerRef` is missing, null or just whitespace:

- `driverDisplayId` gracefully falls back to the same value that was used before (e.g. `load.displayId` or `load.id`),
- so the driver still sees some identifier, even if the broker didn’t enter anything.

────────────────────────
6. FINAL CHECK
────────────────────────

After changes:

1) Create a load and set a broker-facing number in the “Customer Ref / Optional PO #” field (e.g. `SOAR-1360121`).
2) As dispatcher / admin view:
   - On `/app/loads`, you still see the internal ID `LD-2025-4474` (and possibly the customer ref separately).
3) As driver:
   - On `/driver`, each load entry shows ONLY the broker number (`SOAR-1360121`) instead of `LD-2025-4474`.
   - On `/driver/loads/[id]`, the main header also shows ONLY `SOAR-1360121` (or whatever was entered).
4) If you create a load WITHOUT a customer ref, the driver still sees a fallback ID (the previous internal display id), so the UI is never blank.
