You are a senior frontend engineer working inside the existing PingPoint frontend project on Replit.

GOAL
Design and wire up the **Broker Personal Console** (личный кабинет брокера) on the route `/app/loads` in the **Arcade 90s** style.

CONTEXT
- Stack: Next.js App Router (app/), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- We already have:
  - A “Broker Workspace” concept created from the New Load page via broker email.
  - A `BrokerContext` (or similar) that provides current broker info after verification:
    - `broker.name` (from BrokerName field),
    - `broker.email`,
    - `broker.workspaceId`.
  - A loads list view at `/app/loads` showing mock loads in a table.
- Visual style: Arcade / WarCat Mode 90 (scanlines, flicker, neon buttons, dark grid background).

TASK
Transform `/app/loads` into a **Broker Console Dashboard**:

1. **Header / Welcome Bar**
   - At the top of `/app/loads`, replace any generic header with a neon arcade-style header block.
   - Content:
     - Small label above: `BROKER CONSOLE`.
     - Main title:  
       - “Welcome, {BrokerName}” or “{BrokerName} – Your Loads”.
       - BrokerName берём из поля Broker Name, сохранённого в `BrokerContext`.
     - Subtitle text:  
       - “Here is the list of your active and recent loads.”

   - Make sure:
     - If broker name is missing (edge case), fall back to “Broker Console”.
     - Header uses existing arcade styles (scanlines, flicker) and fits the current design.

2. **Primary Actions Row**
   Directly under the header, add an actions row with two main buttons:

   1) **Create Load** (primary)
      - Text: `Create Load`
      - Neon yellow arcade style (same as current “New Load” button).
      - On click: `router.push("/app/loads/new")`.

   2) **Upload Rate Confirmation** (secondary)
      - Text: `Upload Rate Confirmation`
      - Neon blue style (we already use this color for the new button near “New Load”).
      - On click for now:
        - Open a placeholder modal or slide-over with text:
          - “TODO: Rate Confirmation upload flow (PDF/IMG upload, parse, attach to load).”
        - Or navigate to a stub page `/app/rate-confirmation` with a simple message.
      - Add `// TODO` comments where the real upload logic will be implemented.

   Layout:
   - Use `flex` with `gap-3` (and `flex-wrap`) so on mobile the buttons can wrap onto two lines.
   - Keep the existing Filter button if it already exists, but align it with these actions.

3. **Loads List Area**
   - Under the actions row, keep the existing table / list of loads, but treat it as the **“List of his loads”**.
   - If this isn’t implemented yet, show a placeholder arcade-styled panel:

     - Title inside panel: `Your Loads`
     - States:
       - If there are loads: show them in a table as now (Load #, Shipper, Origin/Destination, Status).
       - If there are no loads yet: show an empty state message:
         - “You don’t have any loads yet. Tap ‘Create Load’ to add your first shipment.”

   - Make sure loads are filtered by the current broker workspace if that logic exists; otherwise add a `// TODO` with a comment that in the real backend we will filter by `brokerWorkspaceId`.

4. **Burger Menu (Top Right)**
   - Add a burger-menu icon (three lines) in the top-right corner of the header area (not the browser bar).
   - When clicked, it opens an overlay menu or dropdown with the following items:

     1) `Loads`
        - Action: Close the menu and stay on `/app/loads` (this is the current screen).
        - Later можно использовать для навигации, но сейчас просто якорь.

     2) `Settings`
        - Action for now: open a simple modal or navigate to stub `/app/settings` with text:
          - “Broker settings will live here (profile, notifications, billing).”

     3) `Integrations`
        - Action for now: open a stub `/app/integrations` or modal:
          - “Future integrations with TMS, telematics and AgentOS will live here.”

   - Style:
     - Arcade 90s:
       - burger icon with neon hover glow,
       - dropdown/overlay panel with dark background, light grid, neon borders.
     - Ensure it looks good on mobile (full-screen sheet) and desktop (small dropdown).

   - Add `// TODO` markers for each menu item where real settings/integrations pages will be implemented later.

5. **Verification Awareness (optional banner)**
   - If `broker.emailVerified === false` (or if you don’t have this flag yet, just assume not verified on first load), show a small dismissible banner at the top of the page:

     - Text:  
       - “We’ve sent a verification link to {broker.email}. Please confirm your email to fully activate your workspace.”
     - Style: arcade-style info banner (slight glow, icon, close (X) button).
     - Dismissal should be local (in state) for now; later this can be tied to real backend verification.

6. **General Requirements**
   - Keep all existing `/app/loads` functionality intact:
     - The table still works,
     - filters and navigation are not broken.
   - Use TypeScript with proper types for `Broker`, `Load`, etc.
   - Keep the Arcade 90s theme as default; ensure this page looks consistent with WarCat Mode (scanlines, flicker, neon buttons).
   - Add `// TODO` comments where later backend integration is expected:
     - fetching loads by workspace,
     - real email verification status,
     - real settings/integrations pages,
     - real upload Rate Confirmation flow.

Implement these changes now so that after email verification a broker lands in this arcade-style console at `/app/loads` and sees:
- their name in the header,
- list of their loads,
- big buttons “Create Load” and “Upload Rate Confirmation”,
- burger menu with “Loads / Settings / Integrations”.
