You are the Replit Backend Agent working on the existing `agentos-tracking-core` project.

GOAL: Adjust the header on the **driver dashboard page** (`/driver`, file `src/app/driver/page.tsx`) to a minimal dark bar with the new brand text **“PingPoint by SuVerse labs”**, instead of the current wide silver “metal” header.

We want:
- NO silver/metal gradient at the top.
- Header uses the same dark background color as the app.
- Header is visually slimmer (less vertical height) than the previous bar.
- Centered text:
  - Main: “PingPoint”
  - Secondary: “by SuVerse labs” (smaller, on the same line or just after “PingPoint”).
- “PingPoint” must be visually larger/stronger than “by SuVerse labs”.

Do not change any backend logic or routing; this is a pure UI/layout change.

────────────────────────
1. REMOVE THE SILVER METAL HEADER
────────────────────────

In `src/app/driver/page.tsx`:

1) Find the header block you previously created using classes like:
   - `metal-header`
   - `metal-engraved-main`
   - `metal-engraved-sub`
   with text “TRACKING CORE / BY SUVVERSE LABS” (or similar).

2) Remove this header implementation entirely, and replace it with a simpler dark header described in the next section.

If there is still any old “My Loads / DRIVER: JOHN DOE” header, remove that too. We only want the new PingPoint header at the top.

────────────────────────
2. ADD A NEW DARK HEADER BAR WITH “PINGPOINT BY SUVVERSE LABS”
────────────────────────

Still in `src/app/driver/page.tsx`, at the top of the page content (just before the Today/Upcoming/History tabs), create a new header like this (adapt classNames to the file’s structure):

<header className="w-full mb-4">
  <div
    className="
      flex items-center justify-center
      px-4 py-3
      rounded-b-2xl
      bg-brand-bg
      border-b border-brand-border/70
    "
  >
    <h1 className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-semibold tracking-[0.25em] uppercase text-brand-text/80 text-center">
      <span className="text-brand-text">
        PingPoint
      </span>
      <span className="ml-2 text-[0.65em] font-medium text-brand-muted">
        by SuVerse labs
      </span>
    </h1>
  </div>
</header>

Key points:
- Use the same background color as the app (`bg-brand-bg`). If for some reason `bg-brand-bg` is not available, fall back to the current dark body color (e.g. `bg-[#050608]`).
- The bar should be visually “slim”: `py-3` is enough, no huge height.
- Slight bottom border: `border-b border-brand-border/70` to separate it from the tabs.
- Rounded bottom corners only: `rounded-b-2xl` for a subtle capsule feel.
- Centered text (both horizontally and vertically).

Typography:
- “PingPoint” is the main word:
  - Keep it at base font size (text-sm/text-base/text-lg, depending on breakpoint).
  - Slightly brighter: `text-brand-text`.
- “by SuVerse labs” is smaller:
  - Rendered as a `<span>` with `text-[0.65em]` so it is visibly smaller.
  - Color: `text-brand-muted`.
- Whole `<h1>` uses `tracking-[0.25em]` and `uppercase` to give a “branded” feel, but this can be tweaked according to the current design.

────────────────────────
3. CLEAN UP OLD METAL STYLES (OPTIONAL BUT PREFERRED)
────────────────────────

Open `src/app/globals.css`:

- If there are custom classes like `.metal-header`, `.metal-engraved-main`, `.metal-engraved-sub` created for the silver bar and they are no longer used anywhere in the app, you can safely delete those class definitions to avoid confusion.

Do NOT remove any other global styles; only delete these unused metal-specific classes.

────────────────────────
4. ENSURE TABS COME RIGHT AFTER THE NEW HEADER
────────────────────────

Make sure the existing tab component (Today / Upcoming / History) is rendered immediately after the new `<header>`.

Example high-level structure of the page:

<div className="...">
  <header> ... PingPoint by SuVerse labs ... </header>

  <section className="mt-3">
    {/* existing tab switcher & loads list */}
  </section>
</div>

Do not touch the tab logic or data fetching, only spacing if needed (`mt-3` / `mb-4` etc.).

────────────────────────
5. FINAL CHECK
────────────────────────

After changes:

1) Open `/driver` in Preview:
   - There is no silver/metal gradient header.
   - The top of the screen shows a slim dark bar with centered text:
     **PingPoint** (larger) and **by SuVerse labs** (smaller) on the same line.
   - The header background blends with the app background; it looks like a subtle dark top bar with a bottom border.

2) The tabs (Today / Upcoming / History) appear directly below this header, and the rest of the driver UI works as before.

3) No backend behavior has changed; this is a purely visual update.
