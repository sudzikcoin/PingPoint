You are a senior full-stack engineer. Goal: fix Git PUSH_REJECTED in this Replit workspace for repo sudzikcoin/PingPoint by syncing remote commits into local main safely, resolving conflicts if any, and pushing successfully.

Hard rules:
- Do NOT delete history or force-push unless explicitly instructed.
- Prefer a safe rebase workflow. If rebase becomes too complex, fall back to a normal merge.
- Keep changes minimal and preserve existing code.
- After completion, verify that local main is up to date with origin/main and push succeeds.

Steps:
1) Open Replit Shell and run:
   - git status
   - git remote -v
   - git fetch origin
   - git branch -vv
   - git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all -n 30
   Capture and interpret results.

2) If there are uncommitted changes:
   - git add -A
   - git commit -m "chore: save local WIP before sync" OR if changes should not be committed, do:
     git stash push -u -m "replit: stash before sync"
   Decide the safest option based on status output.

3) Attempt sync with rebase:
   - git pull --rebase origin main
   If conflicts happen:
   - List conflicted files: git status
   - Resolve conflicts carefully (most likely README.md / workflow files). Prefer preserving both sides where possible.
   - After each resolution: git add <file>
   - Continue: git rebase --continue
   - If rebase stops due to repeated conflicts, resolve all and continue until success.

4) If rebase fails or becomes messy:
   - Abort: git rebase --abort
   - Do a merge instead: git pull origin main --no-rebase
   - Resolve conflicts the same way, then commit merge if required.

5) If we stashed changes earlier:
   - Re-apply: git stash pop
   - Resolve any conflicts and commit with message "chore: apply stashed changes after sync" if needed.

6) Push:
   - git push origin main
   If push is rejected due to branch protection, report that clearly and propose creating a PR instead.

7) Final verification:
   - git status (should be clean)
   - git log --oneline --decorate -n 10 (show final history)
   - git rev-parse HEAD and compare with origin/main: git rev-parse origin/main
   - Confirm they match and push is successful.

Output:
- Summarize what caused PUSH_REJECTED in this case (non-fast-forward vs protection).
- List commands executed and any files that had conflicts and how they were resolved.
- Confirm the repo is now synced and pushed.
