You are the Replit Backend Agent working on the PingPoint project.

Problem:
- The broker verification banner shows “WE'VE SENT A VERIFICATION LINK…”, and there is a RESEND button.
- `RESEND_API_KEY` is set and Resend “Hello World” test email arrives, but NO verification emails from the app are received (not even in spam).
- We must NOT change the business logic (banner, tokens, routes). We only need to make real emails actually send and be delivered.

Your tasks:

1) Check the server logs when:
   - `/app/loads` is loaded and the banner appears.
   - The user clicks the **RESEND** button.
   Confirm whether `sendTransactionalEmail` (or equivalent) is being called, or if it still only logs to console.

2) Open the email helper file (e.g. `src/lib/email.ts` or similar):
   - Make sure it reads `process.env.RESEND_API_KEY` (exact name).
   - If `RESEND_API_KEY` is missing, it should log in DEV but not throw in PROD.
   - Ensure the helper is used in the code path for:
     - initial verification email when broker email is set,
     - and when the RESEND button is clicked.

3) Ensure the `from` address:
   - Uses either a verified domain in Resend,
   - OR temporarily use `onboarding@resend.dev` as the `from` address to confirm emails are delivered.
   For now, you may set a safe default:
   - `from = process.env.MAIL_FROM || "onboarding@resend.dev"`.

4) If Resend returns any errors (e.g. “Domain not verified”), handle them:
   - Log a clear message to server logs.
   - Do NOT break the request; just let the frontend still show the banner.

5) After fixing:
   - Trigger sending a verification email when broker email is saved in `/app/settings`.
   - Trigger sending again when RESEND button is clicked.
   - Verify in code that each of these flows calls the email helper with:
     - `to = brokerEmail` from profile,
     - a proper subject,
     - `html` and `text` containing the existing verification link.

Goal:
- When we save a broker email in Settings OR click RESEND on the banner, a real email appears in the Resend dashboard **and** is successfully delivered to the inbox (or at least not blocked due to missing domain verification).
