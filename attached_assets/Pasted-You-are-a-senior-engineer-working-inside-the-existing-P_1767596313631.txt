You are a senior engineer working inside the existing PingPoint repo on GitHub.

GOAL:
Add a single GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs on push + pull_request and shows a CI badge in README.md.

STRICT RULES:
- Minimal localized changes only
- Do NOT modify application logic
- Only add CI workflow files and update README.md
- CI must be reliable and not require production secrets
- If some commands (lint/typecheck) do not exist in package.json, do NOT invent them; detect and run what exists
- Must run tests in CI:
  - `npm run test:run` if it exists, otherwise `npm test` if it exists, otherwise `npx vitest run`
- If e2e exists (`npm run e2e`), run it only as a smoke step AFTER unit tests, and allow skipping if Playwright browsers are not installed (but prefer installing them in CI if reasonable).

TASKS:

A) Create workflow file:
Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
- name: CI
- triggers: push and pull_request on all branches
- job: build-test (ubuntu-latest)
Steps:
1) checkout
2) setup-node (Node 18 or 20) with npm cache
3) npm ci (or npm install if lockfile missing; prefer npm ci when package-lock exists)
4) Run unit tests:
   - If package.json has script "test:run" -> npm run test:run
   - Else if has "test" -> npm test
   - Else -> npx vitest run
5) Run coverage (optional but preferred if "test:coverage" exists):
   - npm run test:coverage
   - Upload ./coverage as an artifact (actions/upload-artifact)
6) Run e2e smoke (only if script "e2e" exists):
   - Install Playwright browsers: npx playwright install --with-deps
   - npm run e2e
If e2e fails due to missing server start, do NOT force it in CI; keep the workflow green by skipping e2e with a clear log message. (Use a simple conditional check for script existence; and for e2e, only run if app can start or if tests use request-based health checks that don’t require a running server.)

B) Add a CI badge to README.md
At the top of README.md (first lines), add a GitHub Actions badge for this workflow.
Use this exact format (do not hardcode the repo owner incorrectly; read it from repo context):
![CI](https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Optionally link it:
[![CI](...badge...)](https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

C) Verification
- Ensure the workflow YAML is valid
- Ensure README badge path matches workflow filename `ci.yml`
- Commit changes

DELIVERABLE:
Commit:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- README.md (badge added)
