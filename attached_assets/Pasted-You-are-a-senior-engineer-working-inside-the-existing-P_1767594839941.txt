You are a senior engineer working inside the existing PingPoint repo.

GOAL:
Add ONE stable E2E smoke test using Playwright that can be run locally via `npm run e2e`.
The smoke test must not require real secrets or a real production DB, and must be deterministic.

STRICT RULES:
- Minimal localized changes only
- Do NOT refactor application logic
- Only add e2e test tooling + minimal safe endpoint if absolutely necessary
- Prefer testing an existing public page or existing health endpoint
- If no reliable public route exists, add a minimal safe endpoint: GET /api/health -> 200 { ok: true }
- Do NOT expose sensitive info in any endpoint
- Keep Playwright config simple and fast

TASKS:

A) Add Playwright dependencies (devDependencies)
- Add: @playwright/test
- Add: playwright
If already present, do not duplicate.

B) Add Playwright config at repo root:
Create `playwright.config.ts` with:
- testDir: "./e2e"
- timeout: 30_000
- use.baseURL from env `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` default "http://localhost:3000"
- use.headless = true
- retries: 0
- reporter: "list"

C) Add ONE smoke spec:
Create `e2e/smoke.spec.ts` that:
1) Requests the health endpoint (preferred):
   - await request.get("/api/health") expecting 200 and JSON { ok: true }
OR, if /api/health does not exist yet, test an existing endpoint that is public and stable (no auth), e.g. public tracking landing or a static page.
2) Also verifies that the HTML page loads:
   - page.goto("/") and assert status 200 and contains a known text from your landing page OR app shell (pick something that exists and is unlikely to change, like "PingPoint" in title/header).
IMPORTANT: Avoid any login flows in smoke test.

D) Add /api/health endpoint ONLY IF missing
In `server/routes.ts` (inside registerRoutes(app)):
Add:
app.get("/api/health", (req, res) => res.json({ ok: true }));
This is non-sensitive and safe.
Do NOT add auth to /api/health.

E) Add npm scripts in root package.json:
- "e2e": "playwright test"
- "e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui" (optional)
- "e2e:install": "playwright install --with-deps" (optional)
Do not remove existing scripts.

F) Verification steps (must be performed now):
1) Ensure app can run locally (or in Replit dev) on port 3000.
2) Run:
   - `npx playwright install --with-deps` (only if needed for first setup)
   - `npm run e2e`
3) Confirm the smoke test passes.

DELIVERABLE:
Commit new/changed files:
- e2e/smoke.spec.ts
- playwright.config.ts
- package.json (devDependencies + scripts)
- server/routes.ts (ONLY if /api/health had to be added)
Do it now with minimal changes.
