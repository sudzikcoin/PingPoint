PingPoint bug fix – Broker/Dispatcher card keeps kicking back to intro animation

Context:
- After converting the project to a Full-Stack App, the landing page at `/` shows:
  1) Intro Pac-Man style animation (truck + ghosts, “LOADING ASSETS…”).
  2) Then the console selector with two cards: “Broker / Dispatcher” and “Driver”.
- When I tap **Broker / Dispatcher**:
  - The Broker console briefly opens.
  - After ~3 seconds I am bounced back to the intro animation + console selector.
- This looks like the intro animation logic (timer or redirect) is still active even after navigation to the Broker console.

Goal:
- Fix navigation so that:
  - Tapping **Broker / Dispatcher** takes me to the Broker console page and keeps me there.
  - The Pac-Man intro plays only on the very first visit to `/` (or can be skipped entirely after the first run).
  - No automatic redirect back to `/` or re-showing the animation after I’ve chosen a console.

Please implement the following changes with minimal edits, preserving all existing Arcade 90s visuals and components.

============================================================
1. FIND WHERE INTRO ANIMATION AND REDIRECT LOGIC LIVE
============================================================

1.1. Locate the intro/landing components:
- Look for components and files with names similar to:
  - `IntroAnimationView`, `LaunchScreen`, `LandingIntro`, `ArcadeIntro`, etc.
- Identify:
  - Where the “PINGPOINT BY SUVERSE LABS” intro with the truck + ghosts is rendered.
  - Where the “SELECT YOUR CONSOLE / Broker / Dispatcher / Driver” screen is rendered.

1.2. Check how the intro switches screens:
- Find any `setTimeout`, `useEffect`, or timer that:
  - Changes a local `phase`/`step` state like `"intro" → "selector"`.
  - Or calls `router.push("/")` after a delay.
- Also check if the intro is placed in a **layout** (e.g. root layout) so that it wraps all routes, including `/app/loads`.

============================================================
2. ENSURE INTRO ONLY AFFECTS THE ROOT ("/") PAGE
============================================================

2.1. If the intro is rendered from a global layout:
- Move the intro logic so it only renders on the `/` page component.
  - Example idea:
    - In `app/page.tsx` (or equivalent), keep:
      - State: `phase: "intro" | "selector"`.
      - `useEffect` with timer to switch `phase` from `"intro"` to `"selector"`.
    - Do **not** include the intro inside `layout.tsx` that wraps `/app/*` routes.

2.2. If you must keep intro in a shared layout:
- Add a guard to avoid affecting non-root routes:
  - Use router pathname or segment:
    - If current path is not `/`, do **not** render intro and do **not** run its timers.
  - Concretely:
    - If `router.pathname !== "/"` (or equivalent in App Router), return `children` directly with no intro overlay or redirects.

2.3. Remove any redirect that forces navigation back to `/`:
- If there is any code like:
  - `router.push("/")` after a timeout, or
  - `router.replace("/")` in a timer,
  - or a global `useEffect` that fires on every render and sends user back to `/`,
  then:
    - Restrict it so it runs **only** when the current route is `/` and phase needs to change from intro → selector.
    - Under no circumstances should it run while user is on `/app/loads` or other console routes.

============================================================
3. REMEMBER THAT INTRO SHOULD RUN ONLY ON FIRST VISIT
============================================================

3.1. Add a simple “hasSeenIntro” flag in localStorage:
- On the root page (`/`) mount:
  - Read `localStorage.getItem("pingpoint_has_seen_intro")`.
  - If value is `"true"`:
    - Skip the intro entirely and go straight to the console selector (no 3-second animation).
  - If not present:
    - Show intro once, then after the 3-second timer:
      - Switch `phase` to `"selector"`.
      - Set `localStorage.setItem("pingpoint_has_seen_intro", "true")`.

3.2. Do NOT reset this flag when navigating to Broker or Driver console.

Result:
- First visit: user sees the Pac-Man animation, then the console selector.
- Subsequent visits / reloads: user sees the selector immediately (no waiting, no flashing).

============================================================
4. FIX BROKER / DISPATCHER CARD ONCLICK
============================================================

4.1. Find the card component for **Broker / Dispatcher**:
- It probably calls `router.push("/app/loads")` (or a similar broker route).

4.2. Ensure there are no side effects here that restart the intro:
- The click handler should ONLY do route navigation.
- Remove any code here that:
  - Changes a global intro state back to `"intro"`,
  - Sets a timer that manipulates the root page,
  - Or touches `hasSeenIntro` (we want it to stay `"true"`).

4.3. Confirm that when you click the card:
- The route becomes `/app/loads` (or the broker console path).
- No intro timers or overlays are still running on this route.

============================================================
5. VERIFY THE FIX
============================================================

After the code changes:

1. From a fresh reload (clear localStorage to test once):
   - Go to `/`.
   - See the intro animation for ~3 seconds.
   - It transitions to the console selector.
   - Click **Broker / Dispatcher**:
     - Broker console opens and STAYS open.
     - You are NOT sent back to the intro after 3 seconds.

2. Reload the app (with localStorage preserved):
   - You should see the console selector (no intro delay).
   - Clicking Broker / Dispatcher again takes you directly to the console and no longer bounces back.

3. Make sure the Driver card behaves similarly, without any jump back to intro.

Please implement these changes now, keeping the existing visual design and animation, but ensuring the intro logic is scoped only to the root `/` page and never overrides navigation to the Broker/Dispatcher or Driver consoles.
