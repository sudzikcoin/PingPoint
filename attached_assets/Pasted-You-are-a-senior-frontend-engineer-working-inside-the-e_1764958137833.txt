You are a senior frontend engineer working inside the existing PingPoint frontend project on Replit.

TASK SUMMARY:
1) On the landing page (`/`), rename the “Dispatcher” card to **“Broker / Dispatcher”**.
2) On the loads list page (`/app/loads`), add a new **neon blue button “Upload Rate Confirmation”** next to the existing yellow **“New Load”** button.

Keep all other behavior and styles intact (including navigation, themes, and animations). Only adjust the specified UI elements.

============================================================
1. UPDATE ROLE CARD TITLE ON LANDING PAGE ("/")
============================================================

Locate the component for the landing “Select your console” screen. It should be rendered from `app/page.tsx` (or a component imported into it) and currently has two cards: one for Dispatcher and one for Driver.

The Dispatcher card likely has something like:

- Title text: `Dispatcher`
- Description: “Manage loads, assign drivers, and track fleet operations from the command center.”
- Click handler / Link: navigates to `/app/loads` (or `/app/loads?role=dispatcher`).

Make the following changes:

1) Change the card title from `"Dispatcher"` to `"Broker / Dispatcher"` (or `"Broker-Dispatcher"` if title style prefers no spaces around the slash, but use `"Broker / Dispatcher"` in the JSX text).

2) Optionally, update the subtitle to reflect the combined role, e.g.:

   - Old: “Manage loads, assign drivers, and track fleet operations from the command center.”
   - New: “Create loads, manage rates, assign drivers, and track operations from the command console.”

3) Do NOT change navigation logic:
   - Card should still navigate to the same route as before (`/app/loads` or `/app/loads?role=dispatcher`). If query `role` is used, you can change the value to `"broker-dispatcher"` or leave as-is and add a `// TODO` note:

   ```tsx
   // TODO: refine role handling; current card represents combined Broker / Dispatcher console.

Ensure visual styling (icons, arcade theme, hover effects) remains the same; only the text content changes.

============================================================
2. ADD “UPLOAD RATE CONFIRMATION” BUTTON ON /app/loads

Open the loads index page: app/app/loads/page.tsx (or the equivalent route). At the top of the page, there should be a header area with:
	•	Title: “Loads”
	•	Subtitle: “Manage shipments and tracking”
	•	Actions row with:
	•	A “Filter” button.
	•	A yellow “New Load” button (currently the main CTA).

Modify this actions row as follows:
	1.	Keep the existing yellow “New Load” button unchanged in text and behavior.
	2.	Directly next to “New Load”, add a new secondary neon-blue button with text:
	•	"Upload Rate Confirmation"
This button should:
	•	Share the same general sizing and typography as “New Load”.
	•	Use a blue neon style consistent with the Arcade theme:
	•	Example Tailwind style (adapt to existing design tokens/components):
	•	bg-cyan-500 / bg-sky-500
	•	hover:bg-cyan-400
	•	shadow-[0_0_20px_rgba(34,211,238,0.6)] (or reuse existing glow class).
	•	Visibly read as a secondary action:
	•	Place it to the RIGHT of “New Load” on desktop.
	•	On mobile (small screens), it can wrap to the next line below; use flex with gap-3 or similar.
	3.	Behavior for now:
	•	Implement a placeholder onClick handler:
	•	For example, open a simple modal or trigger console.log("TODO: Upload Rate Confirmation").
	•	Or navigate to a future route /app/rate-confirmation/upload if you want to stub it out.
	•	Add a clear // TODO comment where future upload logic will go:

// TODO: Implement Rate Confirmation upload flow (file picker, validation, backend upload).



Implementation hints for the button:
	•	If there is a shared Button or PillButton component:
	•	Use it and pass variant="secondary" or override the className to blue neon styles.
	•	Example JSX inside the actions row (pseudo):

<div className="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-3">
  <Button /* Filter */>Filter</Button>

  <Button /* New Load (existing styles) */>
    + New Load
  </Button>

  <Button
    type="button"
    onClick={handleUploadRateConfirmation}
    className="bg-cyan-500 text-slate-950 font-semibold px-4 py-2 rounded-xl shadow-[0_0_20px_rgba(34,211,238,0.6)] hover:bg-cyan-400 active:scale-95 transition"
  >
    Upload Rate Confirmation
  </Button>
</div>



Ensure that:
	•	The layout does not break on mobile (use flex + wrap).
	•	The new button works in both Arcade 90s and Premium Dark themes (colors may appear slightly different, but still readable).

============================================================
3. CHECKS

After implementing:
	1.	Go to /:
	•	The role card that previously said “Dispatcher” must now show “Broker / Dispatcher” with updated subtitle.
	•	Clicking it should still open the same console page.
	2.	Go to /app/loads:
	•	At the top, you should see:
	•	“Filter” button.
	•	Yellow “New Load” button.
	•	Neon-blue “Upload Rate Confirmation” button.
	•	Clicking “New Load” should behave exactly as before.
	•	Clicking “Upload Rate Confirmation” should trigger the placeholder logic (console log or modal) with TODO comment in code.

Keep all other behavior unchanged and ensure there are no TypeScript or runtime errors.
