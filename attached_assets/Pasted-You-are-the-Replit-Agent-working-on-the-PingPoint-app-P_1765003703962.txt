You are the Replit Agent working on the PingPoint app. Please update the **/app/billing** page exactly as described below. Do NOT change routing, pricing logic, or plan counters – only the Billing UI and basic button behaviors.

====================================================
1. KEEP “CURRENT PLAN” CARD UNCHANGED
====================================================
- Leave the top “CURRENT PLAN” card exactly as it is now:
  - Title, “Free Trial”, “Loads this month 0 / 10”, “Extra load price $0.99”.
- Do not touch its layout, data, or styling.

====================================================
2. RESTRUCTURE PAYMENT METHODS SECTION
====================================================
We want two clear groups:

  1) Card Payment  
  2) Crypto Wallet (one button that then shows wallet choices)

Remove the current two separate wallet buttons (“CONNECT METAMASK”, “CONNECT COINBASE WALLET”) and replace them with the structure below.

----------------------------------------------------
2.1 CARD PAYMENT BLOCK
----------------------------------------------------
- Add (or restore) a block with heading:

  - Icon + label: `CARD PAYMENT`
  - Subtitle text:  
    `Pay securely with credit or debit card via Stripe.`

- Inside this block, add ONE primary button, styled like the existing yellow CTA buttons in the app:

  - Label: `Pay with Card`
  - Button style:
    - Full width on mobile, same height / radius / neon style as other primary CTAs (e.g. “CREATE LOAD”).
    - Yellow background with subtle glow on hover, matching the arcade theme.

- Behavior for now (no real Stripe integration required):
  - When the user clicks `Pay with Card`, just open a small toast/light notification or inline message:
    - Example text: `Card payments via Stripe are coming soon.`
  - Implement this in a way that’s easy to later replace with real Stripe checkout (e.g. the onClick handler calls a `handleCardPayment()` function with a `// TODO: integrate Stripe` comment).

Do NOT remove any existing text that mentions Stripe; you can reuse the “coming soon” wording if it already exists.

----------------------------------------------------
2.2 CRYPTO PAYMENT BLOCK
----------------------------------------------------
Below the card block, add a second block dedicated to crypto, replacing the old per-wallet buttons.

- Heading:

  - Icon + label: `CRYPTO PAYMENT`

- Subtitle text (reuse the existing acceptance note, but keep it concise):

  Example:
  `Connect a crypto wallet to pay in USDC. We accept USDC only on Base, Ethereum, and Solana networks.`

- Inside this block there must be **ONE** main button:

  - Label: `Connect Crypto Wallet`
  - Style:
    - Full width.
    - Cyan / neon blue background (similar to your existing cyan CTA style).
    - Same size / radius as the Yellow CTAs, following the Arcade 90s look.

====================================================
3. IMPLEMENT WALLET SELECTION MODAL / SHEET
====================================================
When the user clicks the `Connect Crypto Wallet` button:

- Open a modal (centered) or bottom sheet (mobile-friendly) with:

  - Title: `Connect Crypto Wallet`
  - Short description:
    `Choose a wallet provider to connect. (Demo mode – no real on-chain transactions yet.)`

  - Wallet options as a vertical list of buttons:
    - `MetaMask`
    - `Coinbase Wallet`
    - (Optional: you may add `Phantom` for Solana if it fits the existing design, but MetaMask + Coinbase are required.)

  - Each wallet option button:
    - Fills the width of the modal minus padding.
    - Has a subtle border and hover glow in Arcade 90s style.
    - On click, for now, just:
      - `console.log("Connect <WalletName> clicked")`
      - Show a small temporary toast or inline notice at the bottom of the modal, e.g.:  
        `Wallet connection for <WalletName> is coming soon.`

  - Add a simple “Close” or “Cancel” button / X icon to dismiss the modal.

Implementation details:

- Create a small reusable component, for example:
  - `client/src/components/billing/CryptoWalletModal.tsx`
- Use local React state in the Billing page to control it:

  - `const [isWalletModalOpen, setWalletModalOpen] = useState(false);`
  - `Connect Crypto Wallet` button sets `setWalletModalOpen(true)`.
  - Modal close button calls `setWalletModalOpen(false)`.

- Make sure the modal works well on mobile (no clipped content, scrollable if necessary, dark/backdrop overlay matching the rest of the app).

====================================================
4. CLEANUP AND STYLING
====================================================
- Remove the old separate buttons:
  - `CONNECT METAMASK`
  - `CONNECT COINBASE WALLET`
- Keep any existing informational text at the bottom that explains:
  - No wallet connected / wallet connected state.
  - Supported networks and USDC requirement.
  Adjust wording if necessary so it still makes sense with the new single “Connect Crypto Wallet” entrypoint.

- Preserve the overall Arcade 90s / neon visual style:
  - Same fonts, letter spacing, and glowing headings.
  - Use existing Tailwind classes / utility patterns already used on this page.

====================================================
5. TESTING
====================================================
After changes, manually verify:

1. The **Billing** page shows:
   - “CURRENT PLAN” card (unchanged).
   - A **Card Payment** block with a “Pay with Card” button that shows the “coming soon” message when clicked.
   - A **Crypto Payment** block with a single “Connect Crypto Wallet” button.

2. Clicking `Connect Crypto Wallet`:
   - Opens the modal with wallet choices (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet).
   - Clicking each wallet shows a temporary “coming soon” notice and logs to console.
   - Modal closes correctly when pressing Close / Cancel or clicking outside (if you implement backdrop close).

3. There are no console errors, and all styling is consistent with the rest of the PingPoint Arcade theme.

Make these UI changes only; do not implement real Stripe or on-chain payments yet.
