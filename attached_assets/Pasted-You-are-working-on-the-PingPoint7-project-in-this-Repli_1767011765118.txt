You are working on the PingPoint7 project in this Replit. The tech stack is Next.js 14 with App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind for the frontend and a TypeScript backend with Drizzle + Postgres. Most of the app (broker console, loads, tracking, billing, admin, etc.) is already working and MUST NOT be broken.

The user only wants one thing:

================================================
GOAL: FIX THE “DRIVERS” TAB (NO MORE 404)
================================================
Currently, in the broker console sidebar (the “PingPoint Control” menu that appears on the left in landscape mode), there are two nav items:
- LOADS
- DRIVERS

When the user clicks **DRIVERS**, the app navigates to a route that shows a **404 Page Not Found** with the message “Did you forget to add the page to the router?”. We need to fix this so that DRIVERS opens a real page instead of a 404.

Implement this carefully with minimal changes and without touching anything unrelated.

================================================
STEP 1 – Find the existing DRIVERS link
================================================
1. Search the frontend code for the sidebar component that renders the items “LOADS” and “DRIVERS” (likely inside the broker console layout).
2. Identify:
   - the React component that renders the sidebar,
   - the exact `href` / `Link` target for the DRIVERS item (for example `/app/drivers`, `/app/(broker)/drivers`, or similar).
3. DO NOT change this `href` unless absolutely necessary. Prefer to create the matching page file for that existing route.

================================================
STEP 2 – Create the Drivers page for that route
================================================
1. Under the `app` directory, create the correct App Router page file that corresponds to the DRIVERS href. For example, if the link is:

   - `/app/drivers` → create `app/drivers/page.tsx`
   - `/app/(broker)/drivers` → create `app/(broker)/drivers/page.tsx`

   Use the existing folder structure and layout conventions used by the broker console pages.

2. The page should:
   - use the same neon/arcade visual style as the broker console (background, typography, spacing),
   - integrate with the existing layout shell (header, wrapper components) if such layout is used for the broker console,
   - NOT crash if there are no drivers.

3. Start with a clear title and description, for example:
   - Title: “Drivers”
   - Subtitle: “Manage and view drivers for your loads.”

================================================
STEP 3 – List drivers if backend support already exists
================================================
1. Check if there is already:
   - a `drivers` table in the Drizzle schema, and/or
   - an existing API endpoint like `GET /api/drivers` or similar.

2. If there IS an existing way to fetch drivers:
   - Reuse it rather than inventing a new API.
   - On the Drivers page, fetch drivers for the currently logged-in broker/company (follow the same auth / scoping pattern as the loads list).
   - Render a table with columns such as:
     - Name
     - Phone
     - Email
     - Status (active / blocked, if available)
     - Created At
   - Handle loading and empty states:
     - While loading: show a small “Loading drivers…” message or skeleton.
     - If there are no drivers: show “No drivers yet”.

3. If there is NO existing drivers endpoint or table wired in the code:
   - Do NOT add complicated backend logic.
   - Instead, implement a minimal placeholder page that:
     - clearly says “Drivers management coming soon.”
     - explains that this section will show drivers assigned to loads.
   - This placeholder still counts as a successful fix because the main requirement is to avoid the 404 and show a real page.

================================================
STEP 4 – Keep everything else unchanged
================================================
Very important:
- Do NOT modify:
  - routes or behavior for LOADS,
  - broker console main page,
  - Stripe/billing logic,
  - admin panel,
  - tracking or webhooks,
  - any Solana/testnet monitoring code.
- Do NOT change database migrations unless absolutely necessary for the Drivers page.

================================================
STEP 5 – Manual check
================================================
After implementing the Drivers page:

1. Run the app in dev mode (npm run dev or the existing dev command).
2. Log in as a broker and open the broker console.
3. In landscape mode, click the sidebar item **DRIVERS**:
   - Confirm it NO LONGER shows the 404 page.
   - Confirm the new Drivers page renders correctly (either a real drivers table if wired, or a “coming soon” placeholder).
4. Verify that the LOADS tab and other existing functionality still work as before.

Finally, summarize briefly in a comment or log message which files you created/modified to implement the Drivers page and how to reach it (the route path).
