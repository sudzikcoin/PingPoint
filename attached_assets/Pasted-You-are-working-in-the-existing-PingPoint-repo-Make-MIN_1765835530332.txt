You are working in the existing PingPoint repo. Make MINIMAL, LOCALIZED changes. Do NOT change DB schema. Do NOT touch Resend/email. Do NOT restyle UI. Only implement login visibility + correct routing after logout.

GOAL:
1) Make broker login reachable from the UI:
   - On Landing page, when user selects Broker/Dispatcher console, route to /login (NOT directly to /app/loads).
2) In the in-app System Menu (on /app/loads), show:
   - “LOGIN” when user is NOT authenticated (broker/session missing) -> navigates to /login
   - “LOGOUT” when user IS authenticated -> logs out then navigates to /login
3) After logout, redirect to /login (so user immediately sees the login screen).

Implementation (keep existing arcade/90s styling and menu items intact):
A) Landing route fix
- Edit: client/src/pages/landing.tsx
  Find the Broker/Dispatcher card click handler that currently routes into the app (commonly setLocation("/app/loads...") or similar).
  Change ONLY that handler to:
    setLocation("/login");
  Do not modify any intro/splash/animation logic.

B) Menu: Login/Logout conditional
- Edit: client/src/pages/app-loads.tsx
  Locate the System Menu dropdown (the menu opened by the top-right hamburger).
  Keep existing items: Your Loads, Billing, Settings, Integrations.
  Replace the bottom “SWITCH WORKSPACE / LOGOUT” action with conditional logic:
    - If broker/session exists:
        label: "LOGOUT"
        onClick:
          await api.brokers.logout(); // or the existing logout call used in this file/repo
          setLocation("/login");
    - Else:
        label: "LOGIN"
        onClick:
          setLocation("/login");
  Use the same button/component style classes already used for that bottom menu item. No UI redesign.

C) Ensure logout API exists/works (ONLY if missing)
- If api.brokers.logout() does not exist, implement it minimally in the existing client API layer to call the current backend logout endpoint (or create a minimal endpoint ONLY if the backend already has sessions/cookies wired).
- Do NOT change auth model or add new providers. This is only wiring.

Verification steps:
1) Start dev server.
2) Confirm: Landing -> click Broker/Dispatcher -> goes to /login.
3) Confirm: On /app/loads menu:
   - Logged out: shows LOGIN -> goes to /login.
   - Logged in: shows LOGOUT -> after click, user is logged out and redirected to /login.

Output:
- Summarize exactly which files you changed and why (1–2 lines per file).
- No extra features, no Resend changes, no payment work, no refactors.
