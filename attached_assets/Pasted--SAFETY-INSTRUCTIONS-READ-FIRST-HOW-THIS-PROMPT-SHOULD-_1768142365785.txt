⚠️ SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS - READ FIRST:

HOW THIS PROMPT SHOULD WORK:
1. CREATE NEW README.md content without deleting current file
2. BACKUP existing README.md to README.backup.md first
3. WRITE complete new README following template below
4. Don't reference code that doesn't exist yet
5. Only document features that are actually implemented
6. Don't add fictional features or APIs

WHAT TO PRESERVE:
- Keep any important notes from old README
- Don't delete old README until new one is reviewed
- Maintain accuracy - only document what exists

ROLLBACK PLAN:
- Original README saved as README.backup.md
- Can restore old version anytime
- No code changes, only documentation

---

Create Comprehensive Professional README for PingPoint

IMPORTANT: Only document features that ACTUALLY EXIST in the codebase. Don't add fictional features.

Create a complete, production-ready README.md file following this structure:

# PingPoint 🚚

> Modern freight tracking platform for brokers and carriers

Add badges:
- License: MIT (if applicable)
- Node version: >=18.0.0

## 📋 Overview

Brief description (2-3 sentences):
- What PingPoint does
- Who it's for (freight brokers, carriers)

Key features (only list features that exist in code):
- AI-powered Rate Confirmation PDF parsing (if implemented)
- Load tracking (if implemented)
- Geofencing for automatic arrival/departure (if implemented)
- SMS notifications (if Twilio integrated)
- Driver tracking links (if implemented)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- PostgreSQL >= 14
- npm or yarn

### Installation

Provide step-by-step commands:

1. Clone repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd pingpoint

	1.	Install dependencies
# Backend
cd server
npm install

# Frontend  
cd ../client
npm install

	1.	Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values

	1.	Setup database
cd server
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate

	1.	Start development
# Backend (from server directory)
npm run dev

# Frontend (from client directory)  
npm run dev

Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend: http://localhost:3000

Configuration
List ACTUAL environment variables (check .env.example or code):
Required
	∙	NODE_ENV
	∙	PORT
	∙	DATABASE_URL
	∙	JWT_SECRET
	∙	(others that actually exist)
Optional
	∙	CLAUDE_API_KEY (if PDF parsing exists)
	∙	TWILIO_* (if SMS exists)
	∙	(others that actually exist)
For each variable:
	∙	What it does
	∙	Where to get it
	∙	Example value (safe placeholder)
🏗️ Architecture
Describe ACTUAL tech stack (check package.json files):
Backend:
	∙	Runtime: Node.js
	∙	Framework: Express (if used)
	∙	Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma (if used)
	∙	(other actual dependencies)
Frontend:
	∙	Framework: React (if used)
	∙	Build tool: (check what’s actually used)
	∙	(other actual dependencies)
📚 API Documentation
List ACTUAL API endpoints (check routes/ folder):
Example format:
# Authentication
POST /api/auth/login
Body: { email, password }

# Loads
GET /api/loads
POST /api/loads

Only document endpoints that exist in code.
🧪 Testing
If tests exist:
npm test

If tests don’t exist yet, mention: “Testing framework to be implemented”
🚀 Deployment
Provide basic deployment guidance:
	∙	Recommended hosting platforms
	∙	Build commands
	∙	Environment setup for production
🔒 Security
List ACTUAL security features (check code):
	∙	JWT authentication (if implemented)
	∙	Rate limiting (if implemented)
	∙	CORS configuration (check server.ts)
	∙	(other actual security measures)

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
	1.	Backup existing README.md to README.backup.md first
	2.	Only document features that exist in the code
	3.	Check actual package.json files for dependencies
	4.	Check actual route files for API endpoints
	5.	Check .env.example (if exists) for environment variables
	6.	Be accurate - don’t add fictional content
	7.	Keep language clear and professional
	8.	Format properly with markdown
EXPECTED RESULT:
	∙	Professional, comprehensive README
	∙	100% accurate to actual codebase
	∙	Easy for new developers to understand
	∙	Clear setup instructions
	∙	Proper markdown formatting
	∙	Old README backed up
FILES TO CREATE:
	∙	README.backup.md (copy of current README)
	∙	README.md (new version)
	∙	.env.example (if doesn’t exist, create it)
Don’t create fictional documentation. Only document what exists.
