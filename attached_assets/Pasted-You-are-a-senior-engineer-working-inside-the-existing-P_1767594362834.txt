You are a senior engineer working inside the existing PingPoint GitHub repo.

GOAL:
Add proper project documentation to the repository:
- Main README with features, stack, structure, quick start, links to docs
- docs/ folder with architecture, API reference, setup instructions, DB schema overview, deployment notes, troubleshooting
All content must be created as real markdown files committed into the repo.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT change any application logic, database schema, or runtime behavior
- Only add/modify documentation files (.md) and (optionally) a small docs asset folder if needed
- Keep content accurate to the current PingPoint project: Next.js 14 + TS + Tailwind, Express server/, Postgres + Drizzle, Stripe, Webhooks, Replit, public tracking links, Arcade 90s dark neon design
- Mention known TODOs: RC end-to-end attachment, deeper Admin broker detail page, referral program “coming soon”, telematics planned, DB scaling (indexes/PostGIS/archiving), CO2 calculations in progress
- Use relative links between docs files
- Do not include secrets or real tokens. Use placeholders.

TASKS:

1) Create `docs/` folder and add these files:
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/API.md
- docs/SETUP.md
- docs/DB_SCHEMA.md
- docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
- docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md
(Optional but nice: docs/SECURITY.md and docs/ROADMAP.md)

2) Replace/Update root `README.md` to become the main landing page:
Include:
- What PingPoint is (MacroPoint-like but simpler/cheaper)
- Roles: Broker Console (PingPoint Control), Driver App (PingPoint Driver), Admin, Public tracking links
- Key features list
- Tech stack
- Repo structure
- Quick start linking to docs/SETUP.md
- Docs links section
- Pricing (Free: 3 loads/mo, Pro: $99/mo 200 loads, extra credits ~$0.99/load; optional USDC discount mention)
- Status/TODO section

3) Content requirements per file:

docs/ARCHITECTURE.md must include:
- Overview: client/ (Next.js), server/ (Express), Postgres (Drizzle)
- High-level flow: broker creates load -> driver pings -> public tracking -> analytics -> webhooks
- Notes: multi-tenant brokerId filtering; public tracking read-only; rate-limited pings

docs/API.md must include:
- Endpoint groups (Auth, Loads, Stops, Tracking, Public Tracking, Analytics, Export CSV, Billing, Webhooks, Admin)
- For each group provide a short list of routes (keep it concise but complete)
- Provide at least 3 example curl commands:
  - analytics overview
  - loads list
  - tracking ping
Use placeholders for base URL and tokens.

docs/SETUP.md must include:
- Requirements (Node 18+, Postgres)
- Env vars list (DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, APP_URL)
- Optional: PINGPOINT_CO2_KG_PER_MILE
- Install + run commands (npm install, npm run dev)
- DB migrate command (use whatever scripts exist; if unsure, describe as “drizzle migrate” and note to check package.json scripts)
- Notes about needing login for analytics

docs/DB_SCHEMA.md must include:
- High-level tables and relationships:
  brokers, drivers, loads, stops, tracking_pings, subscriptions/credits/usage, rate_confirmation_files, webhook_config/webhook_delivery_logs, admin tables
- Suggested future indexes: tracking_pings(loadId, createdAt), etc.
- Mention optional future PostGIS + archiving

docs/DEPLOYMENT.md must include:
- Replit deployment notes
- Environment/secrets setup in Replit
- Stripe webhooks + callback URL notes (generic placeholders)
- Webhook signing concept (mention signatures exist, do not expose secrets)

docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md must include:
- Analytics stuck loading: check /api/analytics/overview returns 200; check auth session; mismatch response keys
- Stripe webhook not firing: verify webhook secret, endpoint url
- Tracking pings missing: driver permissions, rate-limiting, location permissions
- Public link not showing: load token, access

(Optional) docs/SECURITY.md:
- Session cookie / auth
- Webhook signature verification
- Multi-tenant brokerId filtering

(Optional) docs/ROADMAP.md:
- Checklist of TODOs with priority

4) After creating files:
- Ensure README links to each docs file correctly
- Ensure markdown formatting is clean

DELIVERABLE:
Commit the new/updated markdown files into the repo:
- README.md
- docs/*.md
