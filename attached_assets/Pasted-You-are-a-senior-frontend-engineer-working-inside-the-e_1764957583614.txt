You are a senior frontend engineer working inside the existing PingPoint frontend project on Replit.

GOAL:
Make the Arcade 90s / WarCat theme the DEFAULT (primary) theme for the whole app. The current “Premium Dark” theme becomes the secondary option. On first visit, the app should open in Arcade 90s; if the user manually switches to Premium Dark, remember that choice (e.g. via localStorage) and respect it on future visits.

Do NOT remove the theme toggle and do NOT break any routes (`/`, `/driver/*`, `/app/loads/*`). Only adjust how the theme is initialized and persisted.

============================================================
1. FIND THE CURRENT THEME SYSTEM
============================================================

1) Search the repo for:
   - “Arcade 90s”, “Premium Dark”, “WarCat”, or similar strings.
   - Theme context/hooks such as `ThemeProvider`, `useTheme`, `ThemeContext`.
   - Any localStorage usage for theme (keys like "pingpoint-theme", "theme", etc.).

2) Identify:
   - Where the initial theme value is chosen (default state / server-side default).
   - Where theme changes are handled (toggle button handlers).
   - How the theme is applied (e.g. a `data-theme` or CSS class on `<body>` or root wrapper).

Do NOT refactor the architecture of this system; just change the defaults and persistence behavior.

============================================================
2. SET ARCADE 90s AS DEFAULT THEME
============================================================

Wherever the initial theme is set, change the default from Premium to Arcade:

- If you see something conceptually like:

  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>("premium");

  change it to:

  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>("arcade");

- If the initial theme comes from localStorage with a fallback:

  const stored = window.localStorage.getItem("pingpoint-theme");
  const initial =
    stored === "premium" || stored === "arcade" ? stored : "premium";

  change the fallback to “arcade”:

  const initial =
    stored === "premium" || stored === "arcade" ? stored : "arcade";

- If there is server-side default logic (e.g. in `app/layout.tsx`), also update that default to “arcade” so the first SSR render matches.

Add a small comment near the default:

// Default theme is now "arcade" (WarCat Mode 90). "premium" is the secondary mode.

============================================================
3. ENSURE PERSISTENCE WORKS
============================================================

1) Confirm that on theme change the chosen theme is stored in localStorage under a single consistent key (e.g. "pingpoint-theme").
2) Keep existing behavior:
   - When user toggles theme, update state AND write the new value to localStorage.
   - On first client load, read localStorage and override the default if a stored value exists.
3) With the new fallback, behavior should be:
   - No stored value → theme = "arcade".
   - Stored "premium" → theme = "premium".
   - Stored "arcade" → theme = "arcade".

If no theme persistence exists yet, add a minimal client-side effect in the theme provider/hook:

- On mount, read localStorage and update theme if a valid value is found.
- Whenever `theme` changes, write it back to localStorage.
- Guard access to `window` with `if (typeof window !== "undefined")` to avoid SSR issues.

============================================================
4. UPDATE THE TOGGLE UI (VISUALS)
============================================================

Find the UI element that lets the user switch between Premium Dark and Arcade 90s (e.g. a pill with “Premium” and “Arcade 90s” labels or a mode switch).

Requirements:
- When the app loads without stored preference, the Arcade 90s side must appear active by default.
- When `theme === "arcade"`:
  - Highlight the Arcade 90s option (glow, active state, border, etc.).
- When `theme === "premium"`:
  - Highlight the Premium option instead.

If there is a two-button pill:
- Map classnames so:

  theme === "arcade"   → Arcade button has active styles.
  theme === "premium"  → Premium button has active styles.

If there is a single toggle:
- Ensure label / icon semantics still make sense: “Arcade 90s” should look like the main mode, with Premium as the alternate.

Add a brief comment:

// Arcade 90s is the primary theme; Premium Dark is the alternate. Toggle reflects `theme` state.

============================================================
5. VERIFY ALL MAIN ROUTES USE THE THEME
============================================================

Manual tests after changes:

1) Clear localStorage for the app domain (or open in an incognito window).
2) Open `/`:
   - The UI (landing page, intro, role selector) should appear in Arcade 90s mode by default (scanlines, WarCat glow, etc.).
3) Navigate to `/driver` and `/app/loads`:
   - They should also render in Arcade 90s (no regression in styling or JS errors).
4) Use the theme toggle:
   - Switch to Premium Dark → all visible pages update styling.
   - Refresh the page → Premium Dark remains active.
   - Switch back to Arcade 90s and refresh → Arcade stays active.

If different parts of the app use separate theme states:
- Normalize them so there is a single source of truth (one ThemeProvider at the top level, e.g. in `app/layout.tsx` or equivalent).
- Remove duplicate theme states where safe, and use context/props instead.

============================================================
6. SAFETY AND CLEANUP
============================================================

- Do NOT delete Premium Dark styles; they must still be fully functional.
- Do NOT hardcode Arcade-specific classes without respecting the theme state if existing code already toggles them.
- Maintain TypeScript types (e.g. union type `Theme = "arcade" | "premium"`). If needed, add “arcade” as a valid value where missing.
- Add `// TODO` comments wherever future refinement is needed (e.g. company-level theme preferences or server-side user settings).

After making these changes, ensure the dev server builds cleanly and there are no TypeScript or runtime errors.
